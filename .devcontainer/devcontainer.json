    // expose ports from this image to the local network, so my phone can see the expo go server.

    // this breaks the QR code and URL displayed by expo. Instead, you must find your host machine's ip 
    // (perhaps with `ifconfig`) and enter that manually, but you only have to do it once per dev environment.
