              This can happen when we start at something we're worried might
              happen and then look for evidence that it will occur.

              If we downplay the good things that are happening to us, we're
              minimizing the positive. Even if our day didn't go 100% as
              planned, it doesn't mean that the 60% that did go right should be
              ignored.

              If a bad situation must be the fault of someone else, we're
              other-blaming. If you failed an exam and you're blaming the
              teacher, you're directing your energy to the wrong place. Someone
              cut you off on the highway? If you honk your horn, flip them off,
              and stew, how is that helping? Now you're cut off and mad!

              This doesn't mean you have to blame yourself for every negative
              situation. You don't have to blame anyone. No one has to be at
              fault if you let the situation pass without attaching blame.

              If we draw conclusions based on just one example, we're

              If you're attributing a negative situation entirely to yourself, you're self-blaming.
              You don't have to be responsible for every bad thing that happens.
              If you're getting caught in traffic and you're berating yourself for not leaving
              earlier, you're self-blaming. Would you treat someone else this way?

            <p>
              If you're assigning someone abilities they don't have, you're using faulty "should" statements.
              For example, if you have a fear of flying and are telling yourself
              "I shouldn't be afraid of this, there's nothing wrong with the airplane!"
              you're putting an undue burden on yourself. You have a fear of flying!
              It's normal for people who have a fear of flying to be afraid flying!
            </p>
            <p>
              Should statements can seem nonsensical when you say it out loud; that's the point! They're illogical!
